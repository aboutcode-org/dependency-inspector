**DepLock** (Dependency Locker) is a command line tool to generate package lockfiles,
and parsable package manifests to make it possible and easy to collect resolved dependencies
and accurate metadata for a project. It uses the standard package management tool for
each package type or ecosystem.

This tool is designed for use before a scan and is deployed as a single,
standalone executable file. It should be running in a shell or command prompt
configured to run the project build, with all required package management tools
pre-installed and configured.

The main usage is to run as a front command before a ScanCode.io or ScanCode Toolkit scan
but it is generic and can be used with any other tool.
